# easy-rbac-plus

Advanced HRBAC (Hierarchical Role Based Access Control) implementation for Node.js based on [easy-rbac](https://github.com/DeadAlready/easy-rbac) by [DeadAlready](https://github.com/DeadAlready)

## Why easy-rbac-plus?

When doing access control for requests on multiple documents–for example GET `/books`—you want to set query filters automatically based on a user's role. [easy-rbac-plus](https://github.com/embrio-tech/easy-rbac-plus) implements this while maintaining the functionality of [easy-rbac](https://github.com/DeadAlready/easy-rbac).
